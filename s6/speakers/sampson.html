                    What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A
                    teenage Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your
                    best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at
                    the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium.
                    Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution
                    of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork
                    in a number of countries in Africa.

                Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his
                Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral
                work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned
                dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the
                growth and function of certopsid horns and frills. Following
                graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American
                Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed by five
                years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College
                of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the
                University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant
                professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and
                curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural
                History. His research interests largely revolve around the
                phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of Late
                Cretaceous dinosaurs. In addition to his museum and
                laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
                work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the
                United States and Canada. He was also the on-the-air host for
                the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a
                book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which
                is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their
                worlds to date.
